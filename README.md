# EDUGraphAPI - Office 365 Education Code Sample

In this sample, we show you how to integrate with school roles/roster data as well as O365 services available via the Graph API. 

School data is kept in sync in O365 Education tenants by [Microsoft School Data Sync](http://sds.microsoft.com).

## Sample Goals

The sample demonstrates:

- Calling Graph APIs, including:

  - [Microsoft Azure Active Directory Graph API](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.ActiveDirectory.GraphClient/)
  - [Microsoft Graph API](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Graph/)

- Linking locally-managed user accounts and Office 365 (Azure Active Directory) user accounts. 

  After linking accounts, users can use either local or Office 365 accounts to log into the sample website and use it.

- Getting schools, sections, teachers, and students from Office 365 Education:

  - [Office 365 Schools REST API reference](https://msdn.microsoft.com/office/office365/api/school-rest-operations)

The sample is implemented with the PHP language and the [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) framework.

> [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) is a PHP web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax.  It attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects.
>
> Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing tools needed for large, robust applications. A superb combination of simplicity, elegance, and innovation give you tools you need to build any application with which you are tasked.

## Prerequisites

### **Deploying and running this sample requires**:

- An Azure subscription with permissions to register a new application, and deploy the web app.

- An O365 Education tenant with Microsoft School Data Sync enabled

  - One of the following browsers: Edge, Internet Explorer 9, Safari 5.0.6, Firefox 5, Chrome 13, or a later version of one of these browsers.

  Additionally: Developing/running this sample locally requires the following:  

  - [PHP 7.0](http://php.net/downloads.php)
  - [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/)
  - [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
  - Familiarity with PHP and [Laravel](https://laravel.com/).

## **Generate a self-signed certificate**

**Generate certificate with PowerShell**

This file will be used in web job.

Run PowerShell **as administrator**, then execute the commands below:

```powershell
$cert = New-SelfSignedCertificate -Type Custom -KeyExportPolicy Exportable -KeySpec Signature -Subject "CN=App-only Cert" -NotAfter (Get-Date).AddYears(20) -CertStoreLocation "cert:\CurrentUser\My" -KeyLength 2048
```

> Note: please keep the PowerShell window open until you finish the steps below.

**Get keyCredential**

Execute the commands below to get keyCredential:

> Note: Feel free to change the file path at the end of the command.

```powershell
$keyCredential = @{}
$keyCredential.customKeyIdentifier = [System.Convert]::ToBase64String($cert.GetCertHash())
$keyCredential.keyId = [System.Guid]::NewGuid().ToString()
$keyCredential.type = "AsymmetricX509Cert"
$keyCredential.usage = "Verify"
$keyCredential.value = [System.Convert]::ToBase64String($cert.GetRawCertData())
$keyCredential | ConvertTo-Json > c:\keyCredential.txt
```

The keyCredential is in the generated file, and will be used to create App Registrations in AAD.

![cert-key-credential](/Images/cert-key-credential.png)

### Export the Certificate and Convert to Base64 String

The following commands will export the certificate and convert it to a base64 string.

```powershell
$password = Read-Host -Prompt "Enter password" -AsSecureString
$bytes = $cert.Export([System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509ContentType]::Pfx, $password)
[System.Convert]::ToBase64String($bytes) | Out-File 'c:\cert-base64.txt'
```

You will be prompted to input a password to protect the certificate. Please copy aside the password. It will be used as the value of the **Certificate Pfx Password** parameter of the ARM Template

The base64 string of the certificate is in the generated text file, and will be used as the value of the **Certificate Pfx Base64** parameter of the ARM Template.

![cert-base64](/Images/cert-base64.png)

Export the certificate 

```
$password = Read-Host -Prompt "Enter password" -AsSecureString

Export-PfxCertificate -Cert cert -Password password -FilePath c:\app_only_cert.pfx
```

## Understand the code

### Introduction

**Solution Component Diagram**

![solution](/Images/solution.jpg)

**Authentication Mechanisms**

We utilized the built-in [authentication](https://laravel.com/docs/5.4/authentication) of the Laravel framework to enable user login.

- **Local users authentication**: implemented by the default Eloquent authentication driver. The `App\User` [Eloquent model](https://laravel.com/docs/5.4/eloquent) is included to access users stored in the database.

- **O365 users authentication**: implemented by [Laravel Socialite](https://github.com/laravel/socialite) and `App\Providers\O365Provider` which is based on the [Microsoft Azure](http://socialiteproviders.github.io/providers/microsoft-azure/) service provider.

  > [Laravel Socialite](https://github.com/laravel/socialite) provides an expressive, fluent interface to OAuth authentication with Facebook, Twitter, Google, LinkedIn, GitHub and Bitbucket. It handles almost all of the boilerplate social authentication code you are dreading writing.
  >
  > Adapters for other platforms like [Microsoft Azure](http://socialiteproviders.github.io/providers/microsoft-azure/) are listed at the community driven [Socialite Providers](https://socialiteproviders.github.io/) website.

[thephpleague/oauth2-client](https://github.com/thephpleague/oauth2-client) is used to handle tokens.

**Data Access**

[Eloquent](https://laravel.com/docs/5.4/eloquent) is used to access data stored in the MySQL database.

The tables used in this demo:

| Table                        | Description                              |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Users                        | Contains the user's information: name, email, password...<br>*o365UserId* and *o365Email* are used to connect the local user with an O365 user. |
| UserRoles                    | Contains users' role. Three roles are used in this sample: admin, teacher, and student. |
| Organizations                | A row in this table represents a tenant in AAD.<br>*isAdminConsented* column records than if the tenant consented by an administrator. |
| TokenCache                   | Contains the users' access/refresh tokens. |
| ClassroomSeatingArrangements | Contains the classroom seating arrangements. |

**Controllers**

Below are the main controllers used by the sample.

| Controller         | Description                              |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| LoginController    | contains actions for local users to log in. |
| O365AuthController | contains actions for O365 users to log in |
| LinkController     | implements the **Local/O365 Login Authentication Flow**. Please check [Authentication Flows](https://github.com/TylerLu/EDUGraphAPI#authentication-flows) section for more details. |
| AdminController    | contains the admin actions               |
| SchoolsController  | contains actions to show schools and classes. `SchoolsService` class is mainly used by this controller. Please check [Office 365 Education API](https://github.com/TylerLu/EDUGraphAPI#office-365-education-api) section for more details. |

All the controllers are under the **app/Http/Controller** folder.

**Middlewares**

We create several middlewares for authentication and authorization.

| Middleware              | Description                              |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| AdminOnlyMiddleware     | Only allows admin to access the protected routes. It is mainly used for AdminController. |
| LinkRequiredMiddleware  | Redirects unlinked users to /link. It is mainly used for the SchoolsController. |
| SocializeAuthMiddleware | Integrate O365 user with PHP authentication framework. The current O365 user could be got through ```Auth:user()```. |

All the middleware are in the **app/Http/Middleware**.

**Services**

Below are the main services used by the sample:

| Service           | Description                              |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| AADGraphService   | Contains methods used to access AAD Graph REST APIs. |
| MSGraphService    | Contains methods used to access MS Graph REST APIs. |
| EducationService  | Contains methods like get user information,  get schools/classes/users/assignments, get/update seating arrangements. |
| CookieService     | Contains methods that used to manage cookies. |
| TokenCacheService | Contains methods used to get and update token cache from the database. |
| UserService       | Contains methods used to manipulate users in the database. |
| AdminService      | Contains administrative methods like consent tenant, manage linked accounts. |

All the services are in the **app/Services** folder.

**Multi-tenant app**

This web application is a **multi-tenant app**. In the AAD, we enabled the option:

![](Images/app-is-multi-tenant.png)

Users from any Azure Active Directory tenant can access this app. Some permissions used by this app require an administrator of the tenant to consent before users can use the app. Otherwise, users will see this error:

![](Images/app-requires-admin-to-consent.png)

For more information, see [Build a multi-tenant SaaS web application using Azure AD & OpenID Connect](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/samples/active-directory-dotnet-webapp-multitenant-openidconnect/).

### Office 365 Education API

The [Office 365 Education APIs](https://msdn.microsoft.com/office/office365/api/school-rest-operations) return data from any Office 365 tenant which has been synced to the cloud by Microsoft School Data Sync. The APIs provide information about schools, sections, teachers, students, and rosters. The Schools REST API provides access to school entities in Office 365 for Education tenants.

In this sample, the `App\Services\EducationService` class encapsulates the Office 365 Education API. 

**Get schools**

~~~typescript
public function getSchools()
{
 return $this->getAllPages( "education/schools", School::class);
}
~~~

~~~typescript
public function getSchool($objectId)
{
    return $this->getResponse( "education/schools/" . $objectId , School::class, null, null);
}
~~~

**Get classes**

~~~typescript
public function getSections($schoolId, $top, $skipToken)
{
    return $this->getResponse( 'education/schools/' . $schoolId . '/classes', Section::class, $top, $skipToken);

}
~~~

```typescript
public function getSectionWithMembers($objectId)
{
    return $this->getResponse( 'education/classes/' . $objectId . '?$expand=members', Section::class, null, null);
}
```
**Get assignments**

```typescript
   public function getAssignments($classId)
    {
        return $this->getAllPages( 'education/classes/' . $classId . '/assignments', Assignment::class);
    }
```
Below are some screenshots of the sample app that show the education data.

![](Images/edu-schools.png)

![](Images/edu-classes.png)

![](Images/edu-class.png)

### Authentication Flows

There are 4 authentication flows in this project.

The first 2 flows (Local Login/O365 Login) enable users to login in with either a local account or an Office 365 account, then link to the other type account. This procedure is implemented in the LinkController.

**Local Login Authentication Flow**

![](Images/auth-flow-local-login.png)

**O365 Login Authentication Flow**

![](Images/auth-flow-o365-login.png)

**Admin Login Authentication Flow**

This flow shows how an administrator logs into the system and performs administrative operations.

After logging into the app with an Office 365 account, the administrator will be asked to link to a local account. This step is not required and can be skipped. 

As mentioned earlier, the web app is a multi-tenant app which uses some application permissions, so tenant administrator must consent the app first.  

This flow is implemented in the AdminController. 

![](Images/auth-flow-admin-login.png)

**Application Authentication Flow**

This flow in implemented in the SyncData WebJob.

![](Images/auth-flow-app-login.png)

An X509 certificate is used. For more details, please check the following links:

- [Daemon or Server Application to Web API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-authentication-scenarios#daemon-or-server-application-to-web-api)
- [Authenticating to Azure AD in daemon apps with certificates](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/samples/active-directory-dotnet-daemon-certificate-credential/)
- [Build service and daemon apps in Office 365](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/office365/howto/building-service-apps-in-office-365)

### Two Kinds of Graph APIs

There are two distinct Graph APIs used in this sample:

|              | [Azure AD Graph API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-graph-api) | [Microsoft Graph API](https://graph.microsoft.io/) |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Description  | The Azure Active Directory Graph API provides programmatic access to Azure Active Directory through REST API endpoints. Apps can use the Azure AD Graph API to perform create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations on directory data and directory objects, such as users, groups, and organizational contacts | A unified API that also includes APIs from other Microsoft services like Outlook, OneDrive, OneNote, Planner, and Office Graph, all accessed through a single endpoint with a single access token. |
| Client       | Install-Package [Microsoft.Azure.ActiveDirectory.GraphClient](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.ActiveDirectory.GraphClient/) | Install-Package [Microsoft.Graph](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Graph/) |
| End Point    | https://graph.windows.net                | https://graph.microsoft.com              |
| API Explorer | https://graphexplorer.cloudapp.net/      | https://graph.microsoft.io/graph-explorer |

> **IMPORTANT NOTE:** Microsoft is investing heavily in the new Microsoft Graph API, and they are not investing in the Azure AD Graph API anymore (except fixing security issues).

> Therefore, please use the new Microsoft Graph API as much as possible and minimize how much you use the Azure AD Graph API.

Below is a piece of code shows how to get "me" from the Microsoft Graph API.

```typescript
public function getMe()
{
    $json = $this->getResponse( "me", null, null, null);
    $assignedLicenses = array_map(function ($license) {
        return new Model\AssignedLicense($license);
    }, $json["assignedLicenses"]);
    ...
}
```

Note that in the AAD Application settings, permissions for each Graph API are configured separately:

![](Images/aad-create-app-06.png) 

### Differential Query

A [differential query](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/Library/Azure/Ad/Graph/howto/azure-ad-graph-api-differential-query) request returns all changes made to specified entities during the time between two consecutive requests. For example, if you make a differential query request an hour after the previous differential query request, only the changes made during that hour will be returned. This functionality is especially useful when synchronizing tenant directory data with an applicationâ€™s data store.

The related code is in the following folder of the project:

- **/DataSync**: contains classes that are used to demonstrate how to sync users.

To sync users, we defined the User class:

```c#
class User
{
    public $id;
    public $jobTitle;
    public $department;
    public $mobilePhone;
    public $isRemoved;
}
```

In run.php, we demonstrate how to use the **DifferentialQuery** to send differential query and get differential result.

```c#
$users = $msGraphHelper->queryUsers($dataSyncRecord->deltaLink,$org->tenantId,$clientId);
```

And how to update (or delete) users in local database with the delta result:

```c#
    foreach ($users as $user) {
        $dbHelper->updateUser($user);
    }
```

Below is the log generated by the SyncData WebJob:
